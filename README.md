# UI Components

A React components library using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction) to host the components.

The components will be organized using the [Atomic UI](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/atomic-ui-components/) methodology:

- Atoms. In Atomic Design, as in chemistry, atoms are the basic elements that help inform everything. In the world of web applications, atoms are the foundational elements, such as HTML tags, fonts, animations, and color palettes. Web design “atoms” can also be less concrete. Examples include buttons or forms.
- Molecules. Molecules are the next-largest building block in the food chain. Created by the joining of different atoms, molecules are complex by nature. Because they’re the product of various atoms, though, it’s possible to break them down, conceptually, into something easier to digest. Examples of web design molecules include the things that become the backbone of the larger design system, such as form labels or input fields.
- Organisms. Atoms combine to form molecules, and molecules combine to form organisms. In the world of Atomic Design, organisms are the elements that shape both the appearance and functionality of a website. They’re also the elements that start to impact UI. The way a developer arranges molecules informs the site experience and the complexity of the finished product. Examples of organisms include logos, search fields, and main navigation.
- Templates. At this phase of the Atomic Design process, we start to break with the chemistry analogy and shift back into the lexicon of web development, as a whole. Templates, then, are “organisms” strung together to create pages or finished products. Templates, online atoms, organisms, and molecules, are highly concrete. They provide a fixed context for the more abstract pieces to fit and are responsible for pulling the site together into something resembling its final form. An HTML wireframe is an excellent example of a template.
- Pages. Pages, finally, are the final element of Atomic Design. According to Frost himself, pages are the specific instances of templates. Pages are the most tangible element of all and are the places users spend most of their time. They’re also one of the most essential phases of the Atomic Design process since the final iteration of pages is where developers get to see whether the entire design system is effective or not. In short, the final appearance of the pages dictates whether the site is ready to launch, or whether the developer needs to loop back and make changes to earlier design elements.
